![pandas_secondary](https://github.com/data-Zee/data-Zee/assets/74703223/abc695f9-7ced-4e0e-bab7-10436aaa76a2)- 👋 Hi, I’m @data-Zee
- 👀 I’m interested in working with data. Especially in learning to build marketing mix models. This is because I used to work as a performance marketing manager for many years.
- 🌱 I started learning SQL and Panda's. With that I have already build a somewhat small and simple regression model.
- 🤓 Completed 9 week Data Science Bootcamp improving my coding: Python, SQL, Pandas and statistical modeling like Scipy, Keras.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on Data Analytical or Marketing Modeling projects. I have expertise in e-commerce businesses. 
- 📫 How to reach me my email, guidoisdeman1@gmail.com or checkout my [portfolio](https://narrow-bottom-6bf.notion.site/Portfolio-eabcf7ac42dd4ad0b0898cea927fd3ea) to see my projects.
