- 👋 Hi, I’m @data-Zee
- 👀 I’m interested in working with data. Especially in learning to build marketing mix models. This is because I used to work as a performance marketing manager for many years.
- 🌱 I started learning SQL and Panda's. With that I have already build a somewhat small and simple regression model.
- 🤓 Then I completed a 9 weeks Data Science Bootcamp which helped me improve my coding skills like Python, SQL, Pandas and work better with statistical modeling like Scipy and Keras.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analytical projects or Marketing Modeling projects. My expertise lies around e-commerce businesses.
